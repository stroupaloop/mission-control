 * OpenClaw companion harness — task-def + ECS service + ALB target group
 * templates rendered from `/fleet/new` form input.
 *
 * Each template emits the exact AWS SDK input objects the create-agent
 * handler passes to RegisterTaskDefinition / CreateService / CreateTargetGroup.
 * Naming is load-bearing — the IAM grants in
 * ender-stack/terraform/modules/iam/main.tf authorize MC against ARN
 * patterns derived from `{prefix}-companion-openclaw-{name}`. Drift
 * between the templated names here and the IAM scopes will silently 403.
 *
 * Two-container task shape (init-config + gateway, dependsOn-gated)
 * with three ephemeral Fargate volumes (config, workspace, plugin-deps).
 * Resolves ender-stack#215. Mirrors the smoke-test pattern at
 * ender-stack/terraform/modules/companion/openclaw/main.tf except for
 * the storage backing — smoke-test uses EFS, MC-created agents use
 * Fargate ephemeral. The all-ephemeral choice fits the platform's
 * external-state architecture (durable state lives in Mem0/KB/S3,
 * not local disk); see research/openclaw-storage-convergence.md
 * (filed alongside this PR's ender-stack-side companion if any).
 *
 * Phase-1 boot mode: gateway runs with `--allow-unconfigured`
 * (baked into the image's entrypoint.sh). The init-config sidecar
 * pre-creates `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and its known-required subdirs
 * (plugin-runtime-deps, agents, canvas) so OpenClaw's non-recursive
 * mkdir at startup doesn't ENOENT against an empty mount. No
 * openclaw.json is written today — schema-aware templating is its
 * own multi-day investigation deferred to a Phase-2.x follow-up.
 *
 * Per-agent extensions, persona configs, and channel-token binding
 * land in Phase 2.4 (#247) — Slack app manifest + per-agent
 * credential paste-back flow.

/**
 * Build the listener-rule input for the shared agents ALB. Path-based
 * routing — two explicit patterns forward to the per-agent target group:
 *   - `/agent/{agentName}`        — exact-name root
 *   - `/agent/{agentName}/*`      — any subpath under the agent
 *
 * The two-pattern shape is load-bearing for prefix-pair agent names.
 * A single `/agent/{name}*` glob would also match a different agent
 * whose name starts with `{name}` (e.g., `bot` + `bot-test` → a
 * request to `/agent/bot-test/api` matches BOTH `/agent/bot*` and
 * `/agent/bot-test*`, and AWS resolves by priority, not specificity —
 * so `bot-test` traffic could silently land on `bot`'s target group).
 * Anchoring with `/{name}` (exact) and `/{name}/*` (subtree) makes the
 * patterns mutually exclusive across distinct agent names. The
 * agentName regex `AGENT_NAME_RE` (constraints.ts —
 * `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,30}[a-z0-9]$`) permits hyphenated names that
 * would trigger this overlap, so the anchoring is required.
 *
 * Priority is computed by the handler from a hash of the agent name;
 * AWS requires unique priorities per listener (collisions are
 * tracked as ender-stack#214).
