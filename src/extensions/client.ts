/**
 * Client-side extension registration.
 *
 * Next.js App Router has two separate module graphs (server + client). The
 * extension manifest (extensions.config.ts) is shared data, but React component
 * references must live in the client graph. This file is the single entrypoint
 * that populates the client-side plugin registry (panels + nav items) at
 * module-load time, before any client component renders.
 *
 * Imported for side-effect by src/extensions/ClientBoot.tsx, which is rendered
 * once inside the root layout. Do not import this from server code.
